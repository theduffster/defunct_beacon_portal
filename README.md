=============

The Beacon Portal website and more, easily accessible from your phone for Beacon Teachers and Students!
You can use the Beacon Portal app to:
-Access your Beacon email
-Send emails through your Beacon account
-Receive emails sent to your Beacon Account
-View your Beacon Account emails (only emails sent to the new Outlook inbox that has replaced SquirrelMail, not ones sent to SquirrelMail)
-Get Beacon email notifications
-With the email part, you can also search, IMAP push email, multi-folder sync, flagging, filing, signatures, bcc-self, PGP, mail on SD & anything else any other email client can do!
-Create and view your schedule (create and edit your schedule by pressing the pencil)
-Add notes to specific bands on your schedule (by long pressing a band in "Schedule")
-Customize the color-scheme to your own liking (by going to " Options" and picking the desired colors)
Coming soon (once the actual Portal website is totally 100%):
-Check your homework that's "due today", and your homework that's "due tomorrow"
If you have any questions, comments, or find bugs (chances are there will be some) please email: lincolnbernard7@gmail.com, or rate the app and comment on it.
Also, if anybody thinks they can come up with better icons/banners, please email me.
